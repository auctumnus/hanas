# Hacking (or, to put it another way, contributing code)

Thanks for wanting to contribute some code! We have a pretty
wide codebase, so there's a lot of area to contribute.

## Backend

See the `README` in `packages/api`. It has a lot more specific info!

## Frontend

vue / typescript / etc, have fun
